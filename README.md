A Meteor.js app that lets you play battleship online with your friends.

The base components of this app have been forked from https://github.com/turbomaze/petra

There is all sorts of interesting stuff by turbomaze so I highly suggest checking out his work.

Instructions for installing Meteor can be found here:

https://www.meteor.com/install

Once you have installed it all you need to do is run the command `meteor` in the base directory.
The app can then be accessed by going to http://localhost:3000/ on a browser.
